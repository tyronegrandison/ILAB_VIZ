[{"Country": "Afghanistan", "Region": "Asia & Pacific", "ISO2": "AF", "Advancement_Level": "Moderate Advancement", "Description": "In 2013, Afghanistan made a moderate advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Government of Afghanistan announced the adoption of a list of 29 jobs/working conditions prohibited for children. The National Directorate of Security\u2019s (NDS) anti-trafficking in persons/smuggling unit hired 37 new personnel for provincial offices, almost doubling the personnel already in place. The Government\u2019s Ministry of Interior (MOI) and Ministry of Defense issued directives to prevent the recruitment and sexual abuse of children by the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and began installing the Afghan Human Resources Information Management System (AHRIMS), which will include information on the age of every member of the ANSF. The Government also began participating in a project to combat child labor in the carpet sector. However, children in Afghanistan continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and the worst forms of child labor in the forced production of bricks. Children also continued to be recruited and used for military purposes by non-state groups, as well as by state groups including the Afghan National Police (ANP) and the Afghan Local Police (ALP). The Government does not have a coordinating mechanism to address child labor, sufficient inspectors to enforce child labor laws, or programs to eliminate child labor in sectors where it is prevalent.", "Year": 2013.0, "Goods": [{"Good_Name": "Bricks", "Child_Labor": "T", "Forced_Labor": "T", "Forced_Child_Labor": "T"}, {"Good_Name": "Carpets", "Child_Labor": "T", "Forced_Labor": "F", "Forced_Child_Labor": "F"}, {"Good_Name": "Coal", "Child_Labor": "T", "Forced_Labor": "F", "Forced_Child_Labor": "F"}, {"Good_Name": "Flowers (poppies)", "Child_Labor": "T", "Forced_Labor": "F", "Forced_Child_Labor": "F"}], "Survey Name": "Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 4", "Children's Work Statistics": [{"Year": "2010-11", "Survey_Source": "MICS 4", "Age_Range": "5-14", "Total_Child_Population": 9040557.1, "Total_Percentage_of_Working_Children": 7.5, "Total_Working_Population": 673949.0, "Agriculture": "", "Service": "", "Industry": ""}], "Education Statistics: Attendance Statistics": [{"Year": "2010-11", "Age_Range": "5-14", "Percentage": 41.8}], "Children Working and Studying (7-14 yrs old)": [{"Year": "2010-11", "Age_Range": 4.6}], "UNESCO Primary Completion Rate": [{"Year": "", "Rate": ""}], "Sources": [{"text": "U.S. Department of State. \"Afghanistan,\" in Country Reports on Human Rights Practices- 2013.

However, children in Burkina Faso continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in mining. Limited resources for the systematic enforcement of child labor laws impede government efforts to protect children from the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the lack of funding has hampered the implementation of child labor policies.

The Government investigated 144 new cases of recruitment of children by illegal, non-state armed groups and convicted six individuals for such crimes. The Government also established an inspection unit within the Ministry of Labor to combat child labor, restructured the National System of Family Well-Being to improve interagency coordination to protect children\u2019s rights, and began to participate in a 4-year, $9 million project to combat child labor and improve workplace health and safety in mining.

In addition, the Government\u2019s child labor coordinating body provided services to more than 600 former child laborers, and various agencies continued to invest in social protection programs designed to reduce child labor. Despite these efforts, children in Costa Rica continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation.

The Government also increased its efforts to enforce child labor law by carrying out significantly more inspections than the previous year, allocating additional resources to labor enforcement, and rescuing 159 child victims of human trafficking. In addition, inter-agency committees at the departmental level took actions to combat child labor, such as withdrawing children from work in garbage dumps. However, children in Guatemala continue to engage in child labor, primarily in agriculture. Lack of Government resources, lack of Labor Ministry authority to impose fines, and inadequate judicial enforcement of court orders remain key challenges for enforcement efforts regarding the worst forms of child labor. None of the 346 child labor cases referred to the labor courts in 2013 resulted in an employer sanction.

The Government participates in several programs to strengthen its national legislation and policies regarding child labor, improve its education system, and withdraw and prevent children from the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Nepal continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Nepal lacks a compulsory education law and children ages 16 and 17 are excluded from the protections of the country\u2019s hazardous work list, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. The number of investigations and convictions for child trafficking is also inadequate given the scope of trafficking in Nepal.", "Year": 2013.0, "Goods": [{"Good_Name": "Bricks", "Child_Labor": "T", "Forced_Labor": "T", "Forced_Child_Labor": "T"}, {"Good_Name": "Carpets", "Child_Labor": "T", "Forced_Labor": "T", "Forced_Child_Labor": "T"}, {"Good_Name": "Embellished Textiles", "Child_Labor": "T", "Forced_Labor": "T", "Forced_Child_Labor": "T"}, {"Good_Name": "Stones", "Child_Labor": "T", "Forced_Labor": "T", "Forced_Child_Labor": "T"}], "Survey Name": "Labour Force Survey", "Children's Work Statistics": [{"Year": "2008.0", "Survey_Source": "LFS", "Age_Range": "5-14", "Total_Child_Population": 6228685.0, "Total_Percentage_of_Working_Children": 33.669431027576444, "Total_Working_Population": 2097162.8, "Agriculture": 88.82843091069721, "Service": 3.0972173600314545, "Industry": 8.074351729271335}], "Education Statistics: Attendance Statistics": [{"Year": 2008.0, "Age_Range": "5-14", "Percentage": 89.54798645299931}], "Children Working and Studying (7-14 yrs old)": [{"Year": "2008.0", "Age_Range": 35.162733748487454}], "UNESCO Primary Completion Rate": [{"Year": 2013.0, "Rate": 99.8}], "Sources": [{"text": "U.S. Embassy- Kathmandu. reporting, January 17, 2014.", "number": "1"}, {"text": "ILO Committee of Experts.

The Ministry of Labor and Employment Promotion (MTPE) approved a tenfold increase in the maximum fine for employers that employ children in the worst forms of child labor. In addition, in an effort to support regional actions to combat child labor, the Government provided specialized training to 23 Regional Commissions for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor. The MTPE, Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Social Development signed an agreement to jointly implement two pilot programs to combat child labor, as called for in Peru\u2019s National Strategy for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor. However, children in Peru continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture and street work, such as street vending and street begging. Labor inspectorates remain underfunded and the number of child labor inspections is insufficient, especially in regions with the highest rates of child labor.

The Government also participates in and implements several programs to combat the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Rwanda continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in domestic service. In 2013, children were recruited, some of them forcibly, by the March 23 Movement (M23) for armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. M23 was an armed group based in the Democratic Republic of Congo that the Government of Rwanda supported, but that was disbanded in November 2013. Rwanda has received an assessment of minimal advancement, because the Government\u2019s support for M23 undermined other advancements made during the year to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.", "Year": 2013.0, "Goods": [{"Good_Name": "Tea", "Child_Labor": "T", "Forced_Labor": "F", "Forced_Child_Labor": "F"}], "Survey Name": "Demographic and Health Survey", "Children's Work Statistics": [{"Year": "2010.0", "Survey_Source": "DHS", "Age_Range": "5-14", "Total_Child_Population": 3013401.0, "Total_Percentage_of_Working_Children": 16.1, "Total_Working_Population": 482180.3, "Agriculture": "", "Service": "", "Industry": ""}], "Education Statistics: Attendance Statistics": [{"Year": 2010.0, "Age_Range": "5-14", "Percentage": 79.1}], "Children Working and Studying (7-14 yrs old)": [{"Year": "2010.0", "Age_Range": 17.569459133877153}], "UNESCO Primary Completion Rate": [{"Year": 2012.0, "Rate": 57.7}], "Sources": [{"text": "Winrock International, Forum for African Women Educationalists, and Netherlands Development Organization.

In addition, the Somalia National Army (SNA) made efforts to prevent recruitment and use of underage personnel, including through screening of soldiers before paying their salaries. The FGS and SNA also promulgated a Code of Conduct that, among other features, expressly prohibited recruitment of personnel below eighteen years of age. However, children in Somalia continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor as child soldiers and in child labor in agriculture.

Fishing coordination centers were created in seven provinces to increase protection for workers, including strengthening monitoring through inspections and registering of workers. In addition, the Government enacted the Transnational Organized Crime Act and ratified the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol in order to strengthen institutional frameworks on transnational organized crimes that can include the worst forms of child labor and human trafficking. The Government improved its data collection systems for reporting on identification and investigations of trafficking cases, and reported on the number of child victims involved in these cases.

In addition, Uganda began to participate in two new child labor projects. However, children from Uganda are reportedly recruited and forcibly abducted to join rebel militias operating in the DRC and Kenya.

The Ministry of Education, MOSAL, and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) are participating in donor-funded programs that target special needs groups, including child laborers and street children, and in rehabilitation of schools affected by violence due the country\u2019s internal conflicts. However, children in Yemen continue to engage in child labor in the agriculture sector and in the worst forms of child labor as child soldiers. Gaps in laws, enforcement, policies, and programs to combat child labor remain. There is no information available on whether enforcement actions were taken during the reporting period, and the child labor policy has not been implemented for more than five years. Both the Yemeni Army and other armed groups continue to use children in the country\u2019s internal conflicts.
