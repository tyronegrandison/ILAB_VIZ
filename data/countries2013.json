The Government of Afghanistan announced the adoption of a list of 29 jobs/working conditions prohibited for children. The National Directorate of Security\u2019s (NDS) anti-trafficking in persons/smuggling unit hired 37 new personnel for provincial offices, almost doubling the personnel already in place. The Government\u2019s Ministry of Interior (MOI) and Ministry of Defense issued directives to prevent the recruitment and sexual abuse of children by the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and began installing the Afghan Human Resources Information Management System (AHRIMS), which will include information on the age of every member of the ANSF. The Government also began participating in a project to combat child labor in the carpet sector. However, children in Afghanistan continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture, and the worst forms of child labor in the forced production of bricks. Children also continued to be recruited and used for military purposes by non-state groups, as well as by state groups including the Afghan National Police (ANP) and the Afghan Local Police (ALP). The Government does not have a coordinating mechanism to address child labor, sufficient inspectors to enforce child labor laws, or programs to eliminate child labor in sectors where it is prevalent.", "Goods": [{"Good_Name": "Bricks", "Good_Sector": "Manufacturing", "Child_Labor": "Yes", "Forced_Labor": "Yes", "Forced_Child_Labor": "Yes"}, {"Good_Name": "Carpets", "Good_Sector":

Albania trained labor inspectors, police officers, prosecutors, and judges on trafficking issues; identified through inspections 26 cases of child labor and 11 cases of child trafficking; and prosecuted four child labor cases, with one conviction.

The Government adopted a National Plan of Action Against Trafficking in Persons for years 2013\u20132015, which seeks to improve victim identification, including for child laborers, and to conduct surveys on working children.

The Government established new guidelines to prioritize child labor in the labor inspectorate system and created a national training academy for labor inspectors. The Government also conducted 8,277 child labor inspections and rescued 7,413 children from child labor. It restructured the National Program to Eradicate Child Labor to improve coordination and provide additional resources to local governments, and established a new national plan to combat sexual violence and commercial sexual exploitation of children. However, children in Brazil continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and domestic service.

It continued to work with international organizations on a program to identify children living and working on the streets. It also continued a reform of its system of orphanages and similar institutions to provide better care to vulnerable children, including street children.

While there is no evidence of a problem, the Government has strengthened its preventive legal framework to help protect children from exploitive labor. In 2013, the Government of Gibraltar enacted the Gibraltar Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Conventions) Regulations, which extends labor protections to children working aboard ships through age 18. However, critical gaps remain in the legal framework to prevent children from being involved in the worst forms of child labor. The legal framework does not appear to define a minimum age for all work, nor does it appear to fully protect children ages 15 through 17 from hazardous work. The law also does not appear to prohibit the use of children in illicit activities that are not of a sexual nature, such as for drug trafficking, theft, or burglary. These gaps continue to leave children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor.", "Goods": [], "Survey_Name": "", "Children Work Statistics": [{"Year": "", "Survey Source": "", "Age Range": "", "Total %": "", "Total Working Population": "", "Agriculture": "", "Service": "", "Industry": ""}], "Education Statistics: Attendance Statistics": [{"Year": "", "Age Range": "", "%": ""}], "Children Working and Studying (7-14 yrs old)": [{"Year": "", "Age Range": "", "Total": ""}], "UNESCO Primary Completion Rate": [{"Year": "", "Rate": ""}], "C. 138 Ratified": "No", "C. 138 Ratified during Reporting Period": "N/A", "C. 182 Ratified": "No", "C. 182 Ratified during Reporting Period": "N/A", "Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Ratified": "No", "Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Ratified during Reporting Period": "N/A", "CRC - Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) Ratified": "No", "CRC-CSEC Ratified during Reporting Period": "N/A", "CRC - Armed Conflict (AC)  Ratified": "No", "CRC - AC Ratified during Reporting Period": "N/A", "Palermo Ratified": "No", "Palermo Ratified during reporting period": "N/A", "Minimum Age for Work Established": "No", "Minimum Age for Work Established or Amended during Reporting Period": "No", "Minimum Age Conforms to International Standards": "No", "Minimum Age for Work": "None", "Minimum Age for Hazardous Work Established": "Yes", "Minimum Age for Hazardous Work Established or Amended during Reporting Period": "No", "Minimum Age for Hazardous Work Conforms to International Standards": "No", "Minimum Age for Hazardous Work": "15.0", "Compulsory Education Age Established": "Yes", "Compulsory Education Age Established or Amended during Reporting Period": "No", "Minimum Age for Compulsory Education Conforms to International Standards": "Yes", "Minimum Age for Compulsory Education": "16.0", "Free Public Education Established": "Yes", "Free Public Education Established or Amended during Reporting Period": "No", "Country has Mechanism to Coordinate its Efforts in Combatting the WFCL": "No", "Country Established or Amended Mechanism to Coordinate during Reporting Period": "No", "National Policy on WFCL Established": "No", "National Policy of WFCL Established or Amended during Reporting Period": "No", "Country Made at least one Effort to Advance the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor": "1.0", "Country made at least one Effort to Change Laws and Regulations": "1.0", "Country Made at least one Enforcement Effort": "0.0", "Country made at least one Coordination Effort": "0.0", "Country made at least one Policy Effort": "0.0", "Country made at least one Social Program Effort": "0.0", "Tables": [{"notes": [], "summary": "None of the following conventions have been extended to Gibraltar (Table 1).", "conventions": [{"ratification": false, "title": "ILO C. 138, Minimum Age"}, {"ratification": false, "title": "ILO C. 182, Worst Forms of Child Labor"}, {"ratification": false, "title": "UN CRC"}, {"ratification": false, "title": "CRC Optional Protocol on Armed Conflict"}, {"ratification": false, "title": "CRC Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography"}, {"ratification": false, "title": "Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons"}], "title": "Ratification of International Conventions on Child Labor"}, {"notes": [], "summary": "The Government has established relevant laws and regulations related to child labor, including its worst forms (Table 2).", "standards": [{"related_legislation": {"sources": "4-6", "legislation": "Employment Act 1953, as amended in 2012;

The Government approved an action plan that outlines specific steps for Government agencies to take from 2013 to 2015 to meet the goals set out in its flagship child labor policy, the Roadmap toward the Elimination of Child Labor in Guatemala. The Government also increased its efforts to enforce child labor law by carrying out significantly more inspections than the previous year, allocating additional resources to labor enforcement, and rescuing 159 child victims of human trafficking. In addition, inter-agency committees at the departmental level took actions to combat child labor, such as withdrawing children from work in garbage dumps. However, children in Guatemala continue to engage in child labor, primarily in agriculture. Lack of Government resources, lack of Labor Ministry authority to impose fines, and inadequate judicial enforcement of court orders remain key challenges for enforcement efforts regarding the worst forms of child labor. None of the 346 child labor cases referred to the labor courts in 2013 resulted in an employer sanction. Guatemala also lacks Government programs targeting sectors in which children are known to engage in exploitative labor, such as domestic service, mining, quarrying, and construction.", "Goods":

The Government continues to implement its National Child Labor Project, its project to assist bonded laborers through the provision of loans and alternative livelihoods, and several social protection schemes that address many of the root causes of child labor. In 2013, the Government passed the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, which protects children from sexual offenses and children and adults from trafficking and forced labor and issued guidelines to each state on how to handle cases of child labor trafficking. The Government also launched the Crime and Criminal Tracking and Networking System, which connects all of India\u2019s 15,000 police stations. However, children in India continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in the manufacturing of a number of products in the informal economy. Basic legal protections for children remain weak. Legislation to prohibit work by children under the age of 14 and to proscribe hazardous work for children under 18 was introduced in Parliament in 2012 but has yet to be passed.", "Goods":

However, children continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including through recruitment and use by illegal armed groups.

Jamaica also continued to participate in the Child Labor Measurement and Policy Development (MAP) program and the Tackling Child Labor through Education (TACKLE) program, through which they published a Child Labor Handbook for Professionals. However, children in Jamaica are engaged in child labor in street work and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation.

During the reporting period, the Director of Public Prosecutions led a human trafficking training for law enforcement officials. In addition, the Government collaborated with ILO-IPEC to conduct a child labor survey. It also continued initiatives to raise awareness about child protection issues, including commercial sexual exploitation. However, children in Kiribati continue to be found in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Kiribati still faces legislative, enforcement, and program gaps. The Government has not adopted a list of hazardous activities prohibited for children, and existing laws fail to fully protect children under 18 from all forms of commercial sexual exploitation.

In early 2013, children were recruited and used for military purposes by non-state groups and independently acting pro-government militias. Some recruited combatants were also detained and charged with crimes for their association with the armed conflict. During the reporting period, the Government signed an inter-ministerial circular to provide legal protection to children involved in armed conflict; signed and implemented a protocol agreement to provide social protection to children associated with armed conflict; disbanded some pro-government militias that were using child soldiers; and funded the National Unit to Fight against Child Labor. Children in Mali continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor as child soldiers and in agriculture and gold mining. Laws relating to the worst forms of child labor do not provide adequate coverage and gaps in enforcement have left children unprotected.", "Goods": [{"Good_Name": "Cotton", "Good_Sector":

Despite the lack of a functioning Constituent Assembly for all of 2013, the Government took several actions to address child labor. The Government doubled the number of labor inspectors; set three new directives on how the rescue, rehabilitation, and reintegration of child laborers is conducted; and began reporting on the number and type of inspections it conducts and the resulting sanctions imposed on violators. Additionally, the Government began using the $4.73 million Central Labor Welfare Fund, which is partially used to rehabilitate former child laborers through support programs, including scholarships and vocational training. The Government participates in several programs to strengthen its national legislation and policies regarding child labor, improve its education system, and withdraw and prevent children from the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Nepal continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Nepal lacks a compulsory education law and children ages 16 and 17 are excluded from the protections of the country\u2019s hazardous work list, leaving children vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. The number of investigations and convictions for child trafficking is also inadequate given the scope of trafficking in Nepal.", "Goods": [{"Good_Name": "Bricks", "Good_Sector": "Manufacturing",

The Government expanded its Program Love to include children from birth to age 6 and, with support from the World Food Program, initiated a national school meal program that targeted 1 million children. The Government also closed La Chureca garbage dump in Managua and created jobs, housing, and a school for the more than 250 families that depended on it for their subsistence. With funding from UNICEF, immigration officials received training on how to identify victims of child trafficking, and social service officials received training on victim care. The Government also ratified the ILO Convention on Domestic Workers. Despite these efforts, children in Nicaragua continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. The Government\u2019s enforcement of labor laws is inadequate, and plans to combat child labor and protect children have not been fully implemented. In addition, Government programs are insufficient to reach the numbers of children engaged in the worst forms of child labor.", "Goods": [{"Good_Name": "Bananas", "Good_Sector": "Agriculture",

The Government continues to implement an array of social programs and projects to combat child labor and bonded labor. However, children in Pakistan continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and the worst forms of child labor in bonded labor. While provincial governments drafted legislation to protect children from the worst forms of child labor in response to a Government-wide decentralization effort, only the Punjab Province passed such legislation.

The Government took steps to consolidate and strengthen its inspection system by transferring inspection authority, in most cases, from regional governments to a new National Labor Inspection Superintendency (SUNAFIL). The Ministry of Labor and Employment Promotion (MTPE) approved a tenfold increase in the maximum fine for employers that employ children in the worst forms of child labor. In addition, in an effort to support regional actions to combat child labor, the Government provided specialized training to 23 Regional Commissions for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor. The MTPE, Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Social Development signed an agreement to jointly implement two pilot programs to combat child labor, as called for in Peru\u2019s National Strategy for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor. However, children in Peru continue to engage in child labor, including in agriculture and street work, such as street vending and street begging. Labor inspectorates remain underfunded and the number of child labor inspections is insufficient, especially in regions with the highest rates of child labor.

The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) updated the country\u2019s hazardous list for children and conducted additional research on child labor in agriculture, the largest child labor sector, to inform policy and programs. The Government also implemented the Convergence Program Against Child Labor (2013\u20132016) to assist local governments in creating child-labor free communities. The President of the Philippines issued an executive order to prevent grave child rights violations by creating improved monitoring systems for children in armed conflict. The Government also passed the Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act to establish a permanent Interagency Council, create a database on trafficking cases, expand provisions to protect victims of trafficking, and establish stronger penalties for violations, including those against children.

However, children in Serbia, particularly Roma children, continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor, including forced begging and commercial sexual exploitation. In addition, the National Assembly did not adopt the 2013\u20132018 national strategy to guide the government\u2019s work in preventing and protecting children from child pornography and trafficking. Serbia\u2019s laws also fail to protect children fully from the worst forms of child labor. Serbia does not specifically prohibit the use, procurement, or offering of a child for the production and trafficking of drugs.

The Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) launched a Go-2-School Initiative with UNICEF support with a goal of enrolling one million children in school during the next 3 years. In addition, the Somalia National Army (SNA) made efforts to prevent recruitment and use of underage personnel, including through screening of soldiers before paying their salaries. The FGS and SNA also promulgated a Code of Conduct that, among other features, expressly prohibited recruitment of personnel below eighteen years of age. However, children in Somalia continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor as child soldiers and in child labor in agriculture. The terrorist organization Al-Shabaab remained the main perpetrator of the abduction and use of child soldiers in Somalia. The SNA also continued to use child soldiers. There are reports that the Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama\u2019a (ASWJ) militia, which to date has refused to become part of the SNA, also used child soldiers.

The Government amended the Basic Conditions of Employment Act to include protections for children working without a contract; approved the third phase of the National Child Labor Action Program; and established guidelines for acceptable household chores. In addition, the Government approved the 2013 Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act, which is a comprehensive national anti-trafficking law that includes specific provisions for child trafficking; but the Act has yet to be promulgated and take effect. The Government also trained labor inspectors on child labor issues and maintained programs that assist vulnerable children, including no-fee schools and school feeding programs. Studies also indicate that the Government\u2019s Child Support Grant and the Old Age Pension may help reduce child labor. However, children in South Africa continue to engage in child labor in agriculture and domestic service.

Despite ongoing political and ethnic conflict, the Government of South Sudan provided training on child rights to child protection officers.

Despite political unrest during the year and the Government entering caretaker status in November 2013, the Government took several actions to address child labor. In collaboration with the private sector, the Government focused on prevention efforts to combat labor abuses, including child labor, in the fishing sector. Fishing coordination centers were created in seven provinces to increase protection for workers, including strengthening monitoring through inspections and registering of workers. In addition, the Government enacted the Transnational Organized Crime Act and ratified the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol in order to strengthen institutional frameworks on transnational organized crimes that can include the worst forms of child labor and human trafficking. The Government improved its data collection systems for reporting on identification and investigations of trafficking cases, and reported on the number of child victims involved in these cases. However, children in Thailand continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the shrimp and seafood processing sector, and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. Thailand remains weak in its enforcement efforts, particularly in the home-based business sectors. The Government also lacks current nationwide data on child labor.", "Goods": [{"Good_Name": "Fish", "Good_Sector": "Agriculture", "Child_Labor": "No", "Forced_Labor": "Yes", "Forced_Child_Labor":

The Government also established Child Protection Delegates in each governorate; continued to provide households vulnerable to child labor with cash transfers, access to health care, and school supplies; and initiated a national school feeding program to reduce drop-outs and improve access to public primary schools. However, children in Tunisia continue to engage in child labor in street work and are engaged in the worst forms of child labor in forced domestic service. Tunisia does not have a law to prohibit human trafficking.

The Government published a national child labor survey and increased the number of labor inspectors by 41, from 958 to 999. In addition, the Government established child labor units in five provinces, which are charged with monitoring and coordinating all child labor projects. The projects specifically target children working in mobile and temporary agriculture, on the streets, and in small and medium sized companies. The Government also approved the 2013 Foreigners and International Protection Law, which includes strengthening coordination mechanisms and services to address human trafficking. However, children in Turkey continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, mostly in mobile seasonal work. The Government does not have laws that protect children working in agricultural enterprises employing fewer than 50 workers or small shops employing up to three persons. It also lacks legal protections for children involved in domestic service and work on the street.", "Goods": [{"Good_Name": "Citrus Fruits", "Good_Sector": "Agriculture", "Child_Labor": "Yes",

It provided the Cyber Crimes Department with new software to track child pornography. The Ministry of Social Protection (MSP) also published standardized guidelines for all regions to use in providing services to trafficking victims. However, children continue to engage in child labor in the service sector and in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation, including pornography. Gaps remain in some areas of laws as well as policy and program implementation. The Criminal Code does not prohibit the possession of child pornography and lacks clarity regarding the age of consent for sexual relationships.

Although the Government continues to publicly deny the use of forced labor, including of children, in the cotton harvest, information indicates that children continue to be required to engage in the worst forms of child labor in cotton production. The Government invited an ILO high level-mission to observe the fall 2013 harvest, and reports indicate that the Government did ensure that young children (under age 15) were able to continue to attend school during the harvest season. However, local government officials continued to close secondary schools (colleges and lyceums) during the harvest, mobilizing children ages 15 to 17 to pick cotton to meet the Government-mandated

During the reporting period, the Government continued implementing a policy to mandate National Minimum Standards in Education, a key component of which is child protection. Vanuatu also continued participating in the ILO Decent Work Country Program (DWCP) and the Pacific Policy, Advocacy, Planning, and Evaluation Program (PAPE). However, limited evidence suggests that children are engaged in child labor in agriculture and are found in the worst forms of child labor in commercial sexual exploitation. The Government lacks a complete preventive legal framework, and Vanuatu has not established a minimum age for hazardous work or developed a list of hazardous activities prohibited to children. Vanuatu has not established a coordinating mechanism to combat the worst forms of child labor and does not implement programs to combat the problem.", "Goods": [], "Survey_Name": "", "Children Work Statistics": [{"Year": "", "Survey Source": "", "Age Range": "", "Total %": "", "Total Working Population": "", "Agriculture": "", "Service": "", "Industry": ""}], "Education Statistics: Attendance Statistics": [{"Year": "", "Age Range": "", "%": ""}], "Children Working and Studying (7-14 yrs old)": [{"Year": "", "Age Range": "", "Total": ""}], "UNESCO Primary Completion Rate": [{"Year": "2010.0", "Rate": "83.6"}], "C. 138 Ratified": "No", "C. 138 Ratified during Reporting Period": "No", "C. 182 Ratified": "Yes", "C. 182 Ratified during Reporting Period": "No", "Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Ratified": "Yes", "Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Ratified during Reporting Period": "No", "CRC -
